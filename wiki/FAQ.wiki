===== How do I format a date or number in my column? =====
If you have a date or numeric column then chances are that you will want to format it. See the [Editors] page for more details on how to do that. Be sure to add a custom [FilterMatcher filter strategy] if your column is filterable. 

===== How do I limit the column to only sort asc or desc? =====
You would need to set the sort order on the html column using the [Components sortOrder] method.
