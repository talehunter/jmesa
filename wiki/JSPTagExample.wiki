JMesa now has a complete [JSPTags tag library]! The tags should be very intuitive and is a very similar facade to the [TableFacade]. In fact for exporting you will be using the [TableFacade] to process the export in the controller.

=== Example ===
The following examples uses JMesa, along with Spring. It also assumes you have already followed the [Setup setup] instructions.

==== code references ====
All the code examples are checked into subversion. The best way to present these examples may be to just let you walk through the source code.

 * [http://jmesa.googlecode.com/svn/tags/jmesaWeb-2.3/src/org/jmesaweb/controller/TagPresidentController.java Controller]
 * [http://jmesa.googlecode.com/svn/tags/jmesaWeb-2.3/web/jsp/tag.jsp JSP]
 * [http://jmesa.googlecode.com/svn/tags/jmesaWeb-2.3/src/org/jmesaweb/controller/TagFilterMatcherMap.java FilterMatcherMap]

Be sure to pay attention to the [Javascript] page link so that you understand how Javascript is used to interact with the table through the onInvokeAction and onInvokeExportAction.

*Note:* If you have a date or numeric column then chances are that you will want to format it. See the [Editors] page for more details on how to do that. Be sure to add a custom [FilterMatcher filter strategy] if your column is filterable. 

_Once you have your table implemented you can use the !ParametersBuilder to [UnitTest test] your code.
