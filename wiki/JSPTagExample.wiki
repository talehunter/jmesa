=== JSP Tag Example ===

All the code examples are checked into subversion. The best way to present these examples may be to just let you walk through the source code.

 * [http://jmesa.googlecode.com/svn/tags/jmesaWeb-3.0/web/jsp/tag.jsp JSP]

Be sure to pay attention to the [Javascript] page link so that you understand how Javascript is used to interact with the table through the onInvokeAction and onInvokeExportAction.

*Note:* If you have a date or numeric column then chances are that you will want to format it. See the [Editors] page for more details on how to do that. Be sure to add a custom [FilterMatcher filter strategy] if your column is filterable. 

_Once you have your table implemented you can use the !ParametersBuilder to [UnitTest test] your code.
