==== How can I export my table data to a PDF, Excel, or CSV file? ====

The best place to read about exporting data is found in the [Exports exports page] or the [ExportTutorial export tutorial].

==== How come my PDF export does not work? ====

First make sure that you have your jmesa-pdf.css in a place where the PDF export can find it. The default location is in a folder called css at the top of the web directory.

The global place to change this location is in the [Preferences preferences]. What you need to modify is the pdf.cssLocation preference.

{{{
pdf.cssLocation=/css/jmesa-pdf.css
}}}

Or you can set it directly in the API for each PDF export.

{{{
if (tableFacade.getLimit().getExportType() == PDF) {
    PdfView view = (PdfView)tableFacade.getView();
    view.setCssLocation("/somefolder/jmesa-pdf.css");
}
}}}

==== How can I plug in my own export view? ====
You can create your own view (extending AbstractExportView) and plug it in.

{{{
if (tableModel.isExporting()) {
   if (tableModel.getExportType().equals(ExportType.PDF)) {
      tableModel.setView(new MyCustomView());
   }   
}
}}}
