This is the first release of the JMesa 2.5 series. The major new features include the ability to add and remove worksheet rows, as well as a very flexible worksheet validation framework. In addition to the new validation the worksheet column will visually change as you type. This means when you tab out of a column the appearance will show as changed immediately, and if there are validation errors it will show that as well.

Also, I wanted to point out that all the work on the worksheet was done by Siddhant Agrawal! The work done was first rate and is cleanly incorporated into JMesa.

In addition to the worksheet changes the exports were reworked to extend the !AbstractExportView. This class implements the relevant [SupportInterfaces support interfaces]. This means that you should now always extend the !AbstractExportView when creating your own export view.

_The reason for the major version change is one of the worksheet interfaces changed, and the deprecated methods throughout the API were removed. I do not expect the changes to effect anyone but I wanted to be safe by having the proper version numbers._
