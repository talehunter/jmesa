I have been reading the Groovy Recipes book recently and I thought it would be a good format for pulling together the JMesa documentation. This will be a work in progress, but the goal is to make this the jumping point to the rest of the wiki. The way this will work is each high level section will be broken down into a question with a brief answer, along with a reference to the rest of the wiki.

==== Introduction to JMesa ====

JMesa takes a Collection of beans or a Collection of maps and uses them to render a table in HTML, XLS, CSV, or any other format you choose. The beans in the Collection are plain old Java objects (POJO) where each attribute has a corresponding getter and setter method. If using maps the attributes would be name-value pairs. You can think of each bean as being one row in the table display.

The [Overview overview] will also get you started learning about the [Limit], [CoreContext] and [View].

== View ==

== Toolbar ==

==== How can I place some text in the max rows droplist?  ====

You can place some text next to the max rows increments label (in the droplist). Just specify the text in the [Messages].

{{{
html.toolbar.text.maxRowsDroplist=items 
}}}

== Table ==

 * === Header Row ===

==== How can I change the header on the table to display other things (like a checkbox)? ====

The header row on the table works with the !HeaderEditor interface behind the scenes. The default header editor is the !HtmlHeaderEditor.

To create your own header editor you typically extend the !AbstractHeaderEditor. This gives you access to CoreContext, WebContext and Column. You could also just implement the HeaderEditor directly if you do not need access to any of these.

For more information read the [Editors] page.

==== How do I change the header row to use a th versus a td element? ====

A few developers requested that there be a way to default the html header column element to a <th> versus a <td> definition.

The default is still a <td> element but you can redefine it in the [Preferences] if needed.

{{{
html.column.header.renderer.element=td
}}}
