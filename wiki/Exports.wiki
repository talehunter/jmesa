=== PDF Export ===

 * In general the PDF's has been worked on quite a bit and should work much better now.
 * The PDF export now uses a separate jmesa-pdf.css file. The PDF export was having problems with the standard stylesheet so I split it out. 

The default css file is defined in the [Preferences]:

{{{
pdf.cssLocation=/css/jmesa-pdf.css
}}}

This means that the application will look for the jmesa-pdf.css in the css folder directly under the web application context. Remember that you can override any default setting by defining your own [Preferences].

Or you could specify the css using the css attribute and set it at runtime before you call the render method.

{{{
String exportType = tableFacade.getLimit().getExport().getType();
if (exportType.equals(PDF)) {
    PdfView pdfView = (PdfView)tableFacade.getView();
    pdfView.setCssLocation("/css/jmesa-pdf-landscape.css");
}
tableFacade.render();
}}}
