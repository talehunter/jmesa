=== Updates for the 2.3.4 release. ===

 * JMesa now works with JDK 1.4 using the [http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/JBossRetro JBoss Retro] project thanks to the work contributed by Benjamin Gould.

I also backported the jmesaWeb project to the jdk1.4 standard and used the new jmesa-snapshot-retro.jar file. I checked it into the trunk as jmesaRetroWeb. I verified that it works against Tomcat 4.1 running against the JDK1.4. The only thing that does not work are the tags as they use the !SimpleTagSupport class and that is not retro-fitted. Work is being done to get a copy of the tags backported but it is not ready to be released yet.

 * Direct porlet support both with and without Spring contributed by Benjamin Gould.
 * New PDF view (PdfPView) using iText directly contributed by Ismail Seyfi. You can use the !ExportType.PDFP enumeration or the string "pdfp" to declare the new view. This new pdf view is much faster and I would recommend anyone doing PDF's to try it out.
 * Better support for Weblogic when using tags.
 * Fixed bug in filter registry and can filter with Maps again.
 * Fixed bug in the !FilterMatcherRegistry that dealt with how filter matchers are retrieved from the registry.
 * Polish (pl_PL) Locale contributed by Roman Janowczyk
