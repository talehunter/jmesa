These are the changes for the upcoming 2.3.4 build.

 * JMesa now works with JDK 1.4 using the [http://wiki.jboss.org/wiki/JBossRetro JBoss Retro] project.

I backported the jmesaWeb project to the jdk1.4 standard and used the new jmesa-snapshot-retro.jar file. I checked it into the trunk as jmesaRetroWeb. I verified that it works against Tomcat 4.1 running against the JDK1.4.

The only thing that does not work are the tags as they use the !SimpleTagSupport class and that is not retro-fitted. Not sure if there is anything we can do about this. It would actually be very easy to create a version of the tags using the older tag notation. You would literally just copy the existing !SimpleTag files, convert the JDK 1.5 code, and then use the older tag notation. Remember that JMesa is written as an API so the only thing we are doing is creating a different front end (or wrapper) by using tags. If anyone in the community is interested in doing that I would support that work completely.

 * Direct porlet support both with and without Spring contributed by Benjamin Gould.
 * New PDF view (PdfPView) using iText directly contributed by Ismail Seyfi.
 * Better support for Weblogic when using tags.
