This page outlines the new features that are in the 2.3.2 release.

 * First and foremost we have a new Grails plugin for JMesa! _give credit to Jeff Jie_
 * The toolbar can now (optionally) display page numbers to click through...very much like the Google search bar. This has been a fairly heavily requested feature so I am glad to offer it now. _give credit to community member that started feature_
 * A French Locale _give credit to community member_
 * The jmesa.js file now has the word jQuery in place of the $ so that it can sit alongside other JavaScript frameworks better.
 * The distribution ships with a minified version of jmesa.js.
 * Fixed bug in tag in which could not decorate a !CellEditor with a !WorkSheetEditor.
