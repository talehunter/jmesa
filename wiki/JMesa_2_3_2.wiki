This page outlines the new features that are in the 2.3.2 release.

 * First and foremost we have a new Grails plugin for JMesa!
 * The toolbar can now (optionally) display page numbers to click through...very much like the Google search bar.
 * A French Locale
 * The jmesa.js file now has the word jQuery in place of the $ so that it can sit alongside other JavaScript frameworks better.
 * Fixed bug in tag in which could not decorate a CellEditor with a WorkSheetEditor.
