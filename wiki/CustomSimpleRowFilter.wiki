This is a quick example that shows how you can modify the !SimpleRowFilter to do something more custom. It gets around an [http://code.google.com/p/jmesa/issues/detail?id=162 edge case] that I was not sure what to do about yet. I thought I would take the opportunity to put a [SupportInterfaces support] interface in so that custom code could get a hold of the !FilterMatcherRegistry to the solve problem as well.

First you need to extend the !SimpleRowFilter and override the getFilterMatchers() method.

{{{
public class CustomSimpleRowFilter extends SimpleRowFilter {

    @Override
    protected Map<Filter, FilterMatcher> getFilterMatchers(Collection<?> items, FilterSet filterSet) {
        Map<Filter, FilterMatcher> filterMatchers = new HashMap<Filter, FilterMatcher>();

        FilterMatcherRegistry registry = getFilterMatcherRegistry();

        // insert custom code

        return filterMatchers;
    }
}
}}}

Then plug your custom !RowFilter into the !TableFacade.

 * API 
{{{
tableFacade.setRowFilter(new CustomSimpleRowFilter());
}}}

 * JSP Tag 
{{{
<jmesa:tableFacade rowFilter="com.mycompany.CustomSimpleRowFilter">
}}}
