==== Why are my characters showing up as "?" on the screen? ====

You need to add the following to the top of the JSP to get it to render correctly:

{{{
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
}}}

==== Can I use AJAX with JMesa? ====

Yes, for sure. All you need to do is build a table using the API and then use some AJAX technology to get the latest display. There is a pretty good writeup about it on the [Javascript] page. You can also take a look at the limit example in the examples source code as that uses AJAX. Remember you can get the examples source in the downloads section.
