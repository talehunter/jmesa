==== Why are my characters showing up as "?" on the screen? ====

You need to add the following to the top of the JSP to get it to render correctly:

{{{
<%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" %>
}}}


==== Sorting Boolean versus boolean ====

By default JMesa uses the apache commons beanutils for sorting. Just recently it was brought to my attention that there is a difference between using the Boolean object versus the boolean primitive. The rules seem to be the following:

 * Boolean as an object needs to have a method that starts with 'get'.
 * boolean as a primitive needs to have a method that starts with either 'get' or 'is'.
