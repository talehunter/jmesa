==== How can I place some text in the max rows droplist?  ====

You can place some text next to the max rows increments label (in the droplist). Just specify the text in the [Messages].

{{{
html.toolbar.text.maxRowsDroplist=items 
}}}

==== How can I create my own custom toolbar items?  ====

You need to create a [CustomToolbarTutorial custom toolbar] and plug it in.

==== How can I display inline page numbers? ====

A heavily requested feature is the ability to display inline page numbers,
similar to how the google search results works. This feature was
implemented with the help from the community and could easily be abstracted
out and put into the API. I will work on getting that into the API. However, in the meantime, I am providing the information if you would like the source code to use now.

You can read more about it and get the [http://groups.google.com/group/jmesa/browse_thread/thread/d3010067e6c89ecf source code] in the google groups.
