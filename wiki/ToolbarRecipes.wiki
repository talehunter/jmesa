==== How can I place some text in the max rows droplist?  ====

You can place some text next to the max rows increments label (in the droplist). Just specify the text in the [Messages].

{{{
html.toolbar.text.maxRowsDroplist=items 
}}}

==== How can I create my own custom toolbar items?  ====

You need to create a [CustomToolbarTutorial custom toolbar] and plug it in.

==== How can I display inline page numbers? ====

A heavily requested feature is the ability to display inline page numbers,
similar to how the google search results works. This feature was
