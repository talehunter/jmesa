==== How can I place some text in the max rows droplist?  ====

You can place some text next to the max rows increments label (in the droplist). Just specify the text in the [Messages].

{{{
html.toolbar.text.maxRowsDroplist=items 
}}}

==== How can I create my own custom toolbar items?  ====

You need to create a [CustomToolbarTutorial custom toolbar] and plug it in.

==== How can I display inline page numbers? ====

_Note: this is available in the upcoming 2.3.2 release but I wanted to updated the docs while I was thinking about it_

A heavily requested feature is the ability to display page numbers,
similar to how the google search results works. This feature was
implemented with the help from the community and will be available in the next release. All you will have to do to use it is enable the page items on the toolbar.

{{{
HtmlToolbar toolbar = new HtmlToolbar();
toolbar.enablePageNumbering(true);
tableFacade.setToolbar(toolbar); 
}}}
