This is the code that corresponds with the [WorksheetTutorial worksheet tutorial].

==== code references ====
All the code examples are checked into subversion. The best way to present these examples may be to just let you walk through the source code.

Be sure to pay attention to the [Javascript] page link so that you understand how Javascript is used to interact with the table through the onInvokeAction and onInvokeExportAction.

*Note:* If you have a date or numeric column then chances are that you will want to format it. See the [Editors] page for more details on how to do that. Be sure to add a custom [FilterMatcher filter strategy] if your column is filterable. 

_Once you have your table implemented you can use the !ParametersBuilder to [UnitTest test] your code.
