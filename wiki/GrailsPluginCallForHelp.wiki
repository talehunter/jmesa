In general the Grails plugin has fallen behind the releases. This is mostly because the developer that originally wrote the plugin is busy, and I have not learned Grails yet. Lately I have been learning ANTLR v3 for another project so I am not sure when I will be able to learn Grails. 

Although people seem to be generally happy with the plugin it would be nice to get it up to the latest release.

I am posting this out as a call for help from the community and see if anyone is interested in updating the plugin. In general JMesa has been very stable and I am sure it would not be that much work. It might even just be a matter of moving the release version up and doing another build. I gave it a shot a few months ago, but encountered errors that I was not able to readily get past. It would be really slick if the build was automated as well to fit in with the current build system. For the build I use Groovy and Ant, as I do love the Groovy!

Everything related to Grails is checked into subversion and I have tried to make [http://code.google.com/p/jmesa/wiki/ProjectBuild checking out] JMesa as easy as possible.

Here are some links that were used when the plugin was first being developed:
