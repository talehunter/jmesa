Here is a list of features for the upcoming 2.3.3 release.

 * Table column grouping support via the GroupedCellEditor.
 * The CoreContext class has new getAttribute() and setAttribute() methods for data that is table scope in nature. This is very useful for cell editors (such as the new GroupedCellEditor) that need to store data between multiple columns.
