I do appreciate the help I have been given with the Maven pom.xml file. However what I would really need is for someone to create a pom.xml file that works perfectly and is something that the Maven team would be willing to accept. In addition I would need the community to work with the Maven team to submit the jar.

Right now having a broken pom.xml file is confusing to developers that want to run the project locally. So, with that I have decided to let go of the Maven support. I am very happy with my Groovy [ProjectBuild build scripts] and they work well. 

I would be fine keeping the JMesa jar file on my !GoDaddy site though and people are welcome to link to it.

_I put the JMesa Maven [http://jmesa.org/maven/pom.xml pom.xml] file on the site and you can use it as a starting point if you want to try and get the JMesa jar file on the Maven repositories._
