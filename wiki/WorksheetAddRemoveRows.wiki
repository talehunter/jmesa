In version 2.5 we now have the ability to add and remove rows in the worksheet. In addition there is also a very flexible validation framework. 

Lets start with a visual! What we have here is a worksheet that has most of the new features applied. The row above the gray line is new. The second row in the body is being deleted. And the forth row is showing us the validation in action.

=== Worksheet Example ===

The code for this example is based on using the new !WorksheetTableFacadeTemplate, which extends the [TableFacadeTemplate] to offer worksheet specific functionality. The template is a powerful extension to the framework and makes working with the worksheet very easy. In general I recommend using the new template for creating tables, but when working with the new worksheet features I would say it is mandatory.

=== Adding Rows ===

The only thing you need to do to turn on the add worksheet row feature is enable the button on the toolbar via the [Preferences preferences]. Then by using the !WorksheetTableFacadeTemplate you automatically gain support for adding rows to the worksheet. To save a row that was added refer to the section (below) on saving the worksheet. _Note: this feature is only supported by the API._

{{{
html.toolbar.addWorksheetRow.enabled=true
}}}

If you have a custom toolbar you need to add the new proper toolbar type.

{{{
addToolbarItem(ToolbarItemType.ADD_WORKSHEET_ROW_ITEM);
}}}

=== Removing Rows ===

To enable the feature of removing a row from the worksheet involves using a special worksheet editor. Then by using the !WorksheetTableFacadeTemplate you automatically gain support for removing rows from the worksheet. To save a row that was removed refer to the section (below) on saving the worksheet. _Note: this feature is only supported by the API._

In this example we declared a made up column called "remove" and added it as the first column. _In general if you declare a column that does not exist JMesa will assume that this is a custom column._

{{{
HtmlColumn remove = htmlRow.getColumn("remove");
remove.getCellRenderer().setWorksheetEditor(new RemoveRowWorksheetEditor());
remove.setTitle("&nbsp;");
remove.setFilterable(false);
remove.setSortable(false);
}}}
