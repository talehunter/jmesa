In version 2.5 we now have the ability to add and remove rows in the worksheet. In addition there is also a very flexible validation framework. 

Lets start with a visual! What we have here is a worksheet that has most of the new features applied. The row above the gray line is new. The second row in the body is being deleted. And the forth row is showing us the validation in action.

=== Example ===

The code for this example is based on using the new [TableFacadeTemplate]. The template is a powerful extension to the framework (starting with version 2.5) and makes working with the worksheet very easy. In general I recommend using the new template, but when working with the new worksheet features I would say it is mandatory.
